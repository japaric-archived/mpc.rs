# `mpc.rs`

Re-implementation of [mpc] in Rust. This was mostly developed as a programming exercise and I don't
intend to support users (other than myself). Only a fraction of the original mpc functionality (the
part that I use everyday) has been re-implemented and it's highly unlikely that I'll re-implement
all the other functionality.

Install with:

```
$ cd mpc
$ cargo install --path .
```

Or with:

```
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/japaric/mpc.rs
```
